                <h1>Medievil</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>MediEvil is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by SCE Cambridge Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. The game is set in the medieval Kingdom of Gallowmere and centres around the charlatan protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque, as he makes an attempt to stop antagonist Zarok's invasion of the kingdom whilst simultaneously redeeming himself.</p>

                <h1>Sir Daniel Fortesque</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Sir Daniel Wigginbottom Fortesque IV (1254 – 1286), usually called Sir Daniel Fortesque, Sir Daniel or simply Dan, was a knight of Gallowmere who became the King's Champion and the Head of the Royal Battalion. His life was cut short in the Battle of Gallowmere against the evil sorcerer Zarok, where he was killed by the first volley of arrows. Despite this, history came to remember him as the Hero of Gallowmere.
                A hundred years later, Sir Dan was mistakenly resurrected by Zarok's magic. Dan used this opportunity to live up to his legend and defeated the sorcerer once and for all, thus gaining access to the afterlife’s Hall of Heroes.</p>

                <h1>Hall of Heroes</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>The Hall of Heroes is a level in MediEvil, where heroes from history spend their time feasting, drinking and arm-wrestling. Unlike every other location in Gallowmere, Sir Dan cannot access this location by conventional means; though he can temporarily visit this location by collecting a Chalice of Souls. With the exception of his personal statue, the statues of the heroes can grant him either a new weapon or another item (such as chests gold, or an energy vial/life bottle) that may prove useful. After collecting all the chalices, Daniel becomes one of the heroes.</p>
